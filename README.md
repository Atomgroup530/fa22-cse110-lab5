 (you said "link to your github pages site expose.html page (as well as the link to explore.html if completed)" but it is not clear what you mean because I can only publish one site per repo, so it makes no sense to link to pages of separate html files except you want us to create an index.html? But you didn't say it. So I just don't think the criteria is clear, that's why I'm just linking to the websites of my fa22-cse110-lab5 and introduction-to-github repo):
